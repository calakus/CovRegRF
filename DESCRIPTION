Description: Covariance Regression with Random Forests (CovRegRF) is a random 
    forest method for estimating the covariance matrix of a multivariate 
    response given a set of covariates. Random forest trees are built with a new 
    splitting rule which is designed to maximize the distance between the sample 
    covariance matrix estimates of the child nodes. The method is described in 
    Alakus et al. (2022) <arXiv:2209.08173>. CovRegRF uses 'randomForestSRC' package 
    (Ishwaran and Kogalur, 2022) by freezing at the version 3.1.0. The custom 
    splitting rule feature is utilised to apply the proposed splitting rule.
